about_plugins_text: |-
    🖇 <b>About plugins</b>
    UserLixo plugins are zipped files with one or more Hydrogram handlers to add to UserLixo. They may add new commands or even alter the habitual UserLixo behaviour.

    Anyone can create a plugin, so it's recommended to always check what you are adding, because it will have access to your account and server once added.

    Plugins can add handlers to both userbot and assistant bot.

    To see the list of plugins, use the command <code>plugins</code>

unknown_command: |-
    Unknown command

about_commands_text: |-
    📒 <b>About commands</b>
    A clean UserLixo install has {total} commands: {commands} and {last_command}.
    Each one can be called using one of the prefixes you defined ({prefixes}), e.g.: {examples}

    When you add plugins, they may add their new commands to the plugins list, but it's not mandatory (a plugin may add commands and not explicitely list them).

    To see the plugins list, use the command <code>commands</code> or its alias <code>cmds</code>.
not_virtualenv_alert: |-
    ✴️ It seems you are not running UserLixo in a virtual environment, and it's dangerous.
    For the guarantee of stability of your projects, stop the script, activate an virtualenv named 'venv' and start UserLixo again.
    Also make sure you read the latest UserLixo's <a href='https://github.com/AmanoTeam/UserLixo/blob/userlixo-czp/README.md'>README</a> at GitHub.
