Multipurpose Python userbot for Telegram

## Requirements

*   Python 3.10+
*   An Unix-like operating system

## Setup

*   Install the requirements by running `pip3 install -Ur requirements.txt` 
*   For the video kebab to work, install ffmpeg.
*   Go to https://my.telegram.org/apps, create a new app and save its api_id and api_hash
*   Rename the ``config.py.example`` to ``config.py`` and fill in the data.
*   If you have userlixo-rfc 1.0, run the ```convert.py``` to convert the database.

## Ai comands
*   To configure the artificial intelligences, you need to download the cookie editor in the browser (for Bing to work it needs to be Edge) and open the sites: https://bing.com/chat, and https://bard.google.com/chat. Using the cookie editor, export to JSON and save in the files `cookies.json` and `bard_cookies.json` respectively.
